# Odin's Forecast a.k.a A Weather App 

## What?
* This is a weather app built in Javascript, HTML, and CSS (no frameworks).
* Weather stats are fetched from [openweathermap](openweathermap.org).
* Photos are fetched from [flickr](flickr.com) depending on the city whose weather you're interested in.

## Why?
* This project was a way for me to practice the async/await feature of Javascript 
and a chance to build another small project from start to finish without the use of tutorials.
* It forms part of [The Odin Project's](theodinproject.com) curriculum. 

### Notes
1. The timestamps displayed for sunrise and sunset still need to be formatted correctly as they currently display times in the user's timezone.
1. This is meant to be viewed on mobile devices as the font and position scaling has not been factored in yet.
